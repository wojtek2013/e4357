2. Search results are returned within 0.36 seconds.

What is happening in the background?
ANSWER:
The search query is redirected to the most optimal server center based on the user location and current load of the servers 
(Source 1 below). 
On the server side GFS (Google File System) (Source 2) and utility algorithms like MapReduce (Source 3) help to extract 
the list of answers.

Despite Google’s simplistic interface, search is complicated. For example when a user in San Francisco enters a query like 
google.com/search?q=blogoscoped, the user’s browser first completes a DNS lookup mapping www.google.com to a specific IP 
address. At this stage, Google’s DNS load balancer determines which cluster of computers at which of Google’s 36+ data 
centers will process the query. If the nearest data center isn’t available to process the query, it’s passed on to the 
nearest available data center. (For this example, the nearest known data centers might be Mountain View, CA, Pleasanton, CA, 
San Jose, CA, Los Angeles, CA, Palo Alto, CA, Seattle, WA, Portland, OR and/or The Dalles, OR.) Once a data center has been 
determined, the query is transmitted via “HTTP” to a specific data center and individual cluster of 1,800 or more servers.
Upon arrival at the data center cluster, each query is greeted by Google’s second load balancer. The Google hardware load 
balancer consists of 10 to 15 machines and determines which machines are available to process the query. The hardware load 
balancer then earmarks and hands off the query to a Google Mixer. This “Google Mixer” software, will later combine all of 
the elements of Universal search results with the right blend of ads. The Mixer, queries a number of Google Web Servers 
(GWS), selecting one available to execute the query. The query is then executed, simultaneously hitting 300 to 400 
back-end machines representing Google’s verticals, advertising and spell check among others. At this point the best results 
are gathered and the query data returns to the Google Mixer. The mixer takes this data, blends Universal elements with ads 
while pasting results in order based on relevancy. The ordered results then go back to the GWS for HTML coding. Once the HTML 
is completed and pages formatted, the search engine results are marked “done” by the load balancer and returned to the user 
as search engine results pages (SERPs). Google search engine results 1-10 of about 517,000 for “blogoscoped" returned in 
.03 seconds. Today it’s estimated that Google queries travel across 700-1000* machines, a figure that has nearly doubled 
since 2006 perhaps due in part to the introduction of Google Universal.
