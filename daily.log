READING:
Started reading about Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is other name for Bluetooth 4.0 standard.

DOING:
Spent over 1hr on mbed.org trying to have some programs running on my Nordic nRF51822 kit.

WHAT WORKED:
Simple Hello World (blinking LED) worked.
This is same code as Hello World (or new project with hello_world_blinky template) for NXP1768 but 
the compiler must be instructed to create executeble file for nRF51822. This is done by clicking button 
in the right-upper part of the compiler screen (just above the code window) and selecting nRF51822 from 
the list of available platforms. Compiler then creates .hex file.

OTHER OBSERVATIONS:
Couldn't put .hex into nRF51822 when used mbed compiler via Chrome browser - antivirus kicked in and 
prevented from downloading .hex file. Had to use Firefox to download .hex file onto nRF51822 flash.

WHAT DIDN'T WORK (YET):
Other programs (BLE Beacon, BLE Thermometer) compile but don't know yet how to check if they work.
Downloaded and installed Android app (Physical Web) on my S4 that was supposed to work together with
Physical Web program from mbed - the app starts and shows "screening for beacon" graphics but nothing 
happens even though Physical Web program is compiled and downloaded on nRF51822.
